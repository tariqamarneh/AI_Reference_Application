current_weather	Bool	No	false	Include current weather conditions in the JSON output.
temperature_unit	String	No	celsius	If fahrenheit is set, all temperature values are converted to Fahrenheit.
windspeed_unit	String	No	kmh	Other wind speed speed units: ms, mph and kn
precipitation_unit	String	No	mm	Other precipitation amount units: inch
timeformat	String	No	iso8601	If format unixtime is selected, all time values are returned in UNIX epoch time in seconds. Please note that all timestamp are in GMT+0! For daily values with unix timestamps, please apply utc_offset_seconds again to get the correct date.

rain	Preceding hour sum	mm (inch)	Rain from large scale weather systems of the preceding hour in millimeter
showers	Preceding hour sum	mm (inch)	Showers from convective precipitation in millimeters from the preceding hour
weathercode	Instant	WMO code	Weather condition as a numeric code. Follow WMO weather interpretation codes. See table below for details.
